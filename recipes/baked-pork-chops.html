        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika, sweet or smoked</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>

    <h2>How to make baked pork chops</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425° F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. (You can also bake pork chops in a baking dish, without parchment.)</li>
        <li>Pat pork chops dry with paper towels. Rub pork chops with the olive oil and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Combine the brown sugar, paprika, onion powder, dried thyme, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.</li>
        <li>Rub the spice mixture over all sides of the pork chops.</li>
        <li>Bake pork chops in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes for 1-inch thick boneless pork chops. The pork chops are done when the internal temperature measures 145° F on an instant read thermometer. (Thinner pork chops will cook faster, bone-in pork chops will take longer to cook. See notes.) Be careful not to overcook the pork chops or they may dry out.</li>
        <li>Let the pork chops rest for 5 minutes and then serve.</li>
    </ul>
